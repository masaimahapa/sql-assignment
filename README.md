In this project, I create a database with 5 tables. 
Namely; Customers, Employees, Products, Payments and Orders.

I connect the to the Postgres database using the psycopg2 module.
For executing queries I use SQLAlchemy as it has better displaying capabilities, in the form of a dataframe through Pandas.
